closure-sbt-plugin
==================

This is a [simple-build-tool](http://simple-build-tool.googlecode.com/) plugin for compiling Javascript using Google's [Closure compiler](http://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/). It was originally forked from [this CoffeeScript plugin](https://github.com/rubbish/coffee-script-sbt-plugin). Most of the project is shameless searching-and-replacing.

More instructions to follow.
